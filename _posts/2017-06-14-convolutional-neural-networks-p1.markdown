# Artificial Intelligence Explained: Convolutional Neural Networks Part 1

## Introduction

I wanted to make a few posts explaining the 'magic' behind artificial intelligence for people who like me aren't math or programming geniuses. 

### What is Artificial Intelligence or A.I?

Google has a pretty good definition of what A.I is:

>The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.
