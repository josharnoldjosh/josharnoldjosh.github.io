# Artificial Intelligence Explained Part 1: Introduction


## Introduction

I wanted to make a few posts explaining the 'magic' behind artificial intelligence for people who like me aren't math or programming geniuses. 

This is the first post in the series that will start from the begining assuming little-to-no knowledge of what A.I is. 


### What is Artificial Intelligence or A.I?

Google has a pretty good definition of what A.I is:

>The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.

However, one misconception people often have is that all A.I is *artificial general intelligence*. 


### Artificial General Intelligence

What is Artificial General Intelligence? Again, Google has a pretty solid definition:

> Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the intelligence of a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can.

Essentially, AGI is the A.I you see in the movies, A.K.A fully sentient beings that are usually hostile towards the human race 🔫 🔪 🔥. 

For better or worse, AGI is far from existance 😱. From the time of writing this post, there is no such thing as artificial intelligence that is sentient in the sense of being human-like. 

However, what has excelled in current years is *Weak AI* or *Narrow AI*, which is as the name suggests, weak and narrow (to a degree). 

### Weak AI / Narrow AI
