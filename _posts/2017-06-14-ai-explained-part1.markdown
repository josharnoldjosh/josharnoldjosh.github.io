# Artificial Intelligence Explained Part 1: Introduction

## Introduction

I wanted to make a few posts explaining the 'magic' behind artificial intelligence for people who like me aren't math or programming geniuses. 

This is the first post in the series that will start from the begining assuming little-to-no knowledge of what A.I is. 

### What is Artificial Intelligence or A.I?

Google has a pretty good definition of what A.I is:

>The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.

However, one misconception people often have is that all A.I is *artificial general intelligence*. 

### Artificial General Intelligence

What is Artificial General Intelligence? Again, Google has a pretty solid definition:

> Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the intelligence of a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can.

Essentially, AGI is the A.I you see in the movies, A.K.A fully sentient beings that are usually hostile towards the human race ðŸ”« ðŸ”ª ðŸ”¥. 

For better or worse, AGI is far from existance ðŸ˜±. From the time of writing this post, there is no such thing as artificial intelligence that is sentient in the sense of being human-like. 

However, what has excelled in current years is *Weak AI* or *Narrow AI*, which is as the name suggests, weak and narrow (to a degree). 

### Weak AI / Narrow AI

I like to define Narrow AI (I prefer this term over Weak AI) as artificial intelligence that can perform one single (or narrow) task, such as recognizing the difference between cat and dog images or convert sound to text. 

Unlike AGI, Narrow AI is a reality today. Siri on the iPhone is an example of the combination of multiple Narrow AI's, such as speech to text among others, that is connected to a database in the cloud. However, Siri is in no way aware of her surroundings, or has any senses or feelings. Narrow AI like Siri can often [easily be tricked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijRPlOF2KQE).

Much of Narrow AI fits under the category of *Machine Learning*, which we will explore in the rest of this post. 

## Machine Learning 

Machine Learning is a subset of A.I that can be defined broadly as machines (or computers) learning to analyse specific sets of data. The best way to explain what machine learning does is to give an example. 

Imagine a dataset of house auctions that contains the following information per sale:

* The sale price of the house
* The size of the entire property 

Machine learning in this case could be used to develop an algorithm that can predict the sale price of a house based on the size of the property. But how would this work intuitively? We can find out by first visualizing our dataset.

Because our dataset contains two variables per house sale, we can visualize the information by plotting it on a graph.

In highschool, you may have learned about linear regression, or in simple terms, *a line of best fit*. Just by looking at this data, we can see that it follows a trend where the house price is (to an extent) directly proportional to the property size, or in other words, the larger the property size, the higher the cost of the house. 

Intuitively, what a machine learning algorithm does is attempt to find the line of best fit in a given dataset and then make predictions using that line of best fit. 

So, our algorithm would first make an effort to find the line of best fit:

And then, if we gave it an input of 0.55 Acres, the machine learning algorithm would draw a line starting from the input value of 0.55 on x axis until it intersects with the line of best fit, and then it would trace a line until it intersects with the y axis to yield a predection of **$13.5 million** for a property size of 0.55 Acres.:

Notice once the algorithm has found a line of best fit, it can make a prediction given any acre size. 

This is in essence how a machine learning algorithm learns to make predictions. Intuitively, it seems pretty simple right? 

Except there are a few caveats...

### Machine Learning Challenges

Although the previous example seemed simple, Machine learning faces the following challenges:

* Dataset size
* The dimension problem 
* Computational power
