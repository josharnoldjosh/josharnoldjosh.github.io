# Artificial Intelligence Explained Part 1: Introduction

## Introduction

I wanted to make a few posts explaining the 'magic' behind artificial intelligence for people who like me aren't math or programming geniuses. 

This is the first post in the series that will start from the begining assuming little-to-no knowledge of what A.I is. 

### What is Artificial Intelligence or A.I?

Google has a pretty good definition of what A.I is:

>The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.

However, one misconception people often have is that all A.I is *artificial general intelligence*. 

### Artificial General Intelligence

What is Artificial General Intelligence? Again, Google has a pretty solid definition:

> Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is the intelligence of a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can.

Essentially, AGI is the A.I you see in the movies, A.K.A fully sentient beings that are usually hostile towards the human race ðŸ”« ðŸ”ª ðŸ”¥. 

For better or worse, AGI is far from existance ðŸ˜±. From the time of writing this post, there is no such thing as artificial intelligence that is sentient in the sense of being human-like. 

However, what has excelled in current years is *Weak AI* or *Narrow AI*, which is as the name suggests, weak and narrow (to a degree). 

### Weak AI / Narrow AI

I like to define Narrow AI (I prefer this term over Weak AI) as artificial intelligence that can perform one single (or narrow) task, such as recognizing the difference between cat and dog images or convert sound to text. 

Unlike AGI, Narrow AI is a reality today. Siri on the iPhone is an example of the combination of multiple Narrow AI's, such as speech to text among others, that is connected to a database in the cloud. However, Siri is in no way aware of her surroundings, or has any senses or feelings. Narrow AI like Siri can often [easily be tricked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijRPlOF2KQE).

Much of Narrow AI fits under the category of *Machine Learning*, which we will explore in the rest of this post. 

## Machine Learning 

You may have heard the term Machine Learning before. To clarify, Machine Learning is a subset of A.I. Machine Learning is essentially machines (or computers) learning to analyse specific sets of data.
