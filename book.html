  			<h1>The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho</h1>

  			<p>The boy's name was Santiago. Dusk was falling as the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church. The roof had fallen in long ago, and an enormous sycamore had grown on the spot where the sacristy had once stood. He decided to spend the night there. He saw to it that all the sheep entered
through the ruined gate, and then laid some planks across it to prevent the
flock from wandering away during the night. There were no wolves in the
region, but once an animal had strayed during the night, and the boy had
had to spend the entire next day searching for it.<p>

			<p>He swept the floor with his jacket and lay down, using the book he had just
finished reading as a pillow. He told himself that he would have to start
reading thicker books: they lasted longer, and made more comfortable
pillows. It was still dark when he awoke, and, looking up, he could see the stars
through the half-destroyed roof. I wanted to sleep a little longer, he thought. He had had the same dream
that night as a week ago, and once again he had awakened before it ended.</p>

			<p>He arose and, taking up his crook, began to awaken the sheep that still
slept. He had noticed that, as soon as he awoke, most of his animals also
began to stir. It was as if some mysterious energy bound his life to that of
the sheep, with whom he had spent the past two years, leading them
through the countryside in search of food and water. "They are so used to
me that they know my schedule," he muttered. Thinking about that for a
moment, he realized that it could be the other way around: that it was he
who had become accustomed to their schedule.</p>

			<p>But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken. The boy
prodded them, one by one, with his crook, calling each by name. He had
always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said. So
there were times when he read them parts of his books that had made an
impression on him, or when he would tell them of the loneliness or the
happiness of a shepherd in the fields. Sometimes he would comment to
them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed.</p>
